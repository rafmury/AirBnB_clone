# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to build an AirBnB-like web application, starting with a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This was done by Raphael Kariuki and Ridwan Farhan

## Project Overview
The initial step involves creating a command interpreter that will manage AirBnB objects. This is a foundational step that sets the stage for the entire project. The command interpreter will allow you to perform various operations on objects, including creating, retrieving, updating attributes, and more. This functionality will be crucial for building subsequent components of the web application, such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, and API integration.

## Key Tasks and Learning Objectives
During this project, you'll accomplish the following key tasks:

Implement a parent class called BaseModel responsible for initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances.
Create a serialization/deserialization flow involving instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and files.
Define classes for different AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from BaseModel.
Develop the first abstracted storage engine for the project, known as File storage.
Write comprehensive unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.
Through these tasks, you'll achieve the following learning objectives:

### Gain proficiency in creating a Python package.
Develop a command interpreter using the cmd module.
Understand the concept of unit testing and its implementation in a large project.
Learn how to serialize and deserialize a class.
Master file handling and manipulation using JSON.
Manage datetime and UUID in Python.
Familiarize yourself with *args and **kwargs.
Handle named arguments effectively.
Getting Started
To begin, follow these steps:

Review the cmd module and its functionality.
Understand the concept of packages in Python.
Explore the uuid and datetime modules.
Study the unittest module for writing effective unit tests.
Familiarize yourself with the concepts of *args and **kwargs.
Requirements and Guidelines
Your Python scripts should be compatible with Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
Each script should have a shebang line (#!/usr/bin/python3) and end with a new line.
Maintain a clean code style following pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
All modules, classes, and functions should have appropriate documentation.
Create a README.md file at the root of the project folder to provide context and instructions.
